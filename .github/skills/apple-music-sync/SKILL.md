# Apple Music Sync

Sync a playlist from this repository to Apple Music using Playwright browser automation of the [Apple Music web player](https://music.apple.com). Works on any platform. No Apple Developer enrollment, API keys, or native apps are required.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user:
- Wants to save a playlist to Apple Music
- Asks to sync, export, or push a playlist to their library
- Wants to create an Apple Music playlist from a markdown file
- Mentions "Apple Music," "sync," or "add to my library" in the context of a playlist

## Prerequisites

- An **Apple Music subscription**
- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **Playwright** — install with `npm install playwright && npx playwright install chromium`

## Tools

### `sync.mjs` — Sync playlist to Apple Music

A single cross-platform script that manages playlists entirely through the Apple Music web player.

```bash
# Sync a playlist (create if needed, add tracks)
node .github/skills/apple-music-sync/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md [--headless]

# Delete and recreate (full rebuild)
node .github/skills/apple-music-sync/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md --delete-first [--headless]

# Reorder an existing playlist to match the markdown
node .github/skills/apple-music-sync/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md --reorder [--headless]

# Rename an existing playlist (old name → new name from markdown heading)
node .github/skills/apple-music-sync/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md --rename-from="Old Name" [--headless]

# Only add tracks to library (no playlist management)
node .github/skills/apple-music-sync/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md --library-only [--headless]
```

The script:
1. Parses the playlist name from the `# heading` and tracks from the markdown table
2. **Appends the 🤖 emoji** to the playlist name — all managed playlists are suffixed with this marker
3. **Creates a daily backup** before any sync or reorder operation (see Backups below)
4. Opens Chromium with the Apple Music web player
5. Waits for the user to sign in (persistent browser profile — only needed once)
6. Navigates to each track's permalink and adds it via the web player's context menu
7. Verifies each add by checking the playlist track count
8. Reports any tracks that couldn't be found or added

**Playlist safety:** The script will only ever delete or modify playlists that end with the 🤖 suffix. User-created playlists without this marker are never touched.

### Backups

Before every sync or reorder, the script creates a backup playlist named `<name> 📀 (yyyy-MM-dd)`. The backup uses the 📀 emoji (not 🤖) to distinguish it from managed playlists. The playlist description is copied into the backup.

**⚠️ Backups are immutable.** Once created, a backup must **NEVER** be modified, renamed, or deleted by automation. The `assertManaged` guard will throw an error if any operation attempts to touch a playlist containing the 📀 marker. Only one backup per playlist per day is created; if today's backup already exists, it is skipped.

**Flags:**
- `--delete-first` — Delete the existing playlist before recreating it (full rebuild)
- `--reorder` — Reorder an existing playlist to match the markdown without deleting it. Finds the first track out of place, removes tracks from that point onward, and re-adds them in the correct order.
- `--rename-from="Old Name"` — Rename an existing playlist. The old name is looked up in Apple Music; the new name comes from the markdown `# heading`.
- `--library-only` — Only add tracks to the user's library without managing the playlist
- `--headless` — Run in headless browser mode (no visible window)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Playlist

Determine which playlist markdown file to sync from the `playlists/` folder.

### Step 2: Sync to Apple Music

```bash
node .github/skills/apple-music-sync/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md
```

The browser will open. The script uses a persistent browser profile, so if the user has previously signed in, it will detect this automatically and proceed without prompting.

If sign-in is required (first run or expired session), the script will pause and wait. Tell the user to sign in interactively in the browser window and let you know when they've signed in. Once they confirm, create the signal file to proceed (the script prints the exact path).

For reordering (delete from change point and re-add):
```bash
node .github/skills/apple-music-sync/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md --reorder [--headless]
```

For renaming (uses the Edit dialog on the playlist page):
```bash
node .github/skills/apple-music-sync/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md --rename-from="Old Name" [--headless]
```

For full rebuild (delete and recreate):
```bash
node .github/skills/apple-music-sync/sync.mjs playlists/<name>.md --delete-first [--headless]
```

### Step 3: Verify

Ask the user to check the playlist in Apple Music. Confirm the track count and order look correct.

## Error Handling

- If a track cannot be found in search results, the script reports it and continues with the remaining tracks
- If the playlist already exists and `--delete-first` is not set, the script adds tracks to the existing playlist
- The user may need to manually add tracks that the script couldn't find (e.g., region restrictions, name mismatches)
- If Playwright or Chromium is not installed, the script will fail with an import error — run `npm install playwright && npx playwright install chromium` to fix
