# Puscifer

Complete studio discography for Puscifer, organized by album in chronological order.

## Playlist Instructions

### Management

- The playlist is defined in this file — this is the source of truth
- Use the **artist-catalog** skill for rebuilding or updating
- Use the **apple-music-sync** skill for syncing to Apple Music
- Sync with: `node .github/skills/apple-music-sync/sync.mjs playlists/puscifer.md --headless`

### Ordering

- Tracks are ordered by album release date, then by track number within each album
- Do not shuffle — the chronological album order is intentional

### Sync Strategy

- Sync adds tracks **album-at-a-time** — navigating to each album page and adding all tracks to the playlist in sequence
- This is faster and more reliable than individual song lookups
