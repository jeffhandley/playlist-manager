## Playlist Instructions

### Management

- The playlist is defined in this file — this is the source of truth
- Use the **playlist-creator** skill for rebuilding or updating
- Use the **apple-music-sync** skill for syncing to Apple Music
- Sync with: `node .github/skills/apple-music-sync/sync.mjs playlists/90s-alternative-rock.md --headless`

### Ordering

- Tracks are ordered by album release date, then by track number within each album
- Albums from all artists are interleaved chronologically
- Focus on timeless hits and their full albums
- Do not shuffle — the chronological album order is intentional

### Scope

- Full albums for iconic releases; selected hits for other artists
- No duplicate songs — if a song appears on a later re-recording, only the original is included
